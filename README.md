This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.12. If you're interested in contributing you can find more information on the [about page.](http://www.xivraidhub.com/about)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Development also requires running [XIV Raid Hub API](https://github.com/smithk58/xiv-raid-hub-api). May also require [XIV Raid Hub Bot](https://github.com/smithk58/xiv-raid-hub-bot) if you're touching functionality that requires the bot, such as alarms.

## Code scaffolding

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests
