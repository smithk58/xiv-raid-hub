Just a misc. way to track stuff I want to do, but is a low enough priority that I might forget.

* Dark theme stuff:
  * list-group-item-dark on group items
  * bg-dark and text-white on cards
  * Dark theme for accordion (not built into bootstrap, probably have to utilize bg-dark/text-white)
  * Dark theme for ng-select
  * Dark theme for modals
  * Dark theme for buttons
  * Toggle for dark vs light theme 
* The http cache just arbitrarily caches all data calls for a day since last executed. Should probably make this longer for reports (define via an annotation on the function maybe? If done via an annotation should probably make it an opt in thing.).
* Show DPS over fight, to see where your DPS drops vs others (line graph)
* Pin/save certain reports w/ tags and notes
* Comparison groups you create should be taggable
